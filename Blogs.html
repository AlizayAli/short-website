<h1> <i>Geoffrey Chaucer 1343-1400 </i>:</h1>
<hr />

<p> Geoffrey Chaucer stands as the<i> <b>great giant of English poetry</b></i>. His verse is still read and enjoyed today and often adapted for theatre performances. It is full of characters, still recognisable as types we encounter in daily life in spite of having been inspired by people Chaucer observed more than seven hundred years ago.
<br />

There is a freshness in Chaucer’s poetry. His characters act their lives out in every conceivable human situation from the deeply serious to the crude, belly laughing comical. His stories are both funny and thought-provoking: people caught in sexual mix-ups; two young knights fighting to the death for the love of a beautiful young woman; a badly behaved young knight travelling the country on a desperate quest to find the answer to a question that will save his life and learning a great lesson; the tragic love story of Tristan the son of the Trojan king, and the beautiful young Isolde; young wives giving their old husbands the slip to sleep with handsome young suitors. The list of human tales goes on indefinitely, and all of them still appealing to the modern reader. If a writer can connect with a readership seven centuries after his death he is most certainly a great writer.
<br />

Geoffrey Chaucer led an <b><i>eventful, exciting life</b></i>, by any standards. He is known to us as a poet and, indeed, he has the distinction of being the first poet to be buried in poet’s corner in Westminster Abbey, but that was, to him, not much more than an interest. He was an immensely, multi, talented man with a long and very successful full-time career as a diplomat. He was also a <b><i>philosopher, astronomer and alchemist</b></i>.
<br />

In his own time Chaucer would have been far better known as a diplomat than a poet. He was greatly valued by Edward III. During the Hundred Years War, Chaucer was on a mission to Rhiems in 1360, when he was captured. The King paid a £16 ransom, which was worth a few hundred thousand dollars in today’s currency, to get him back.
<br />

Chaucer was deeply immersed in public life and he established a family tradition of that, his son, Thomas rising to distinguished heights, including the position of Speaker of the House of Commons.
<br />

While pursuing his career, Chaucer was writing his poems and reading them aloud at court, no doubt amid great laughter. His most famous work is The Canterbury Tales, a series of fictional tales related by pilgrims on their way to Canterbury, and part of its fame and importance is that it was revolutionary as an English literary work. It is not only written in vernacular English but its characters talk in a naturalistic way, according to their class and background – something unknown in English literature until this moment. The narrators of the stories talk in a way fitted to their characters and states of life rather than in stylised conventional language. Readings of such verse would have been immensely engaging and the language offered opportunities for humour. Chaucer had many jobs during his life – soldier, messenger, valet, administrator, clerk etc. – and had observed colleagues in all of these areas, allowing him to portray them convincingly in his tales.
<br />

Chaucer’s influence on English literature is one thing; he also had an enormous influence on the development of the English language. This is clear when one looks at other English texts of his time, which are almost unrecognisable as English while his are fairly easily comprehensible to the modern reader. In using language the way he did he pointed the way forward.<br /><br />

<h1><i> William Blake 1757-1827</i> : </h1>
<hr />
<p> Although not highly regarded either as a <b><i>painter or poet</b></i> by his contemporaries William Blake has the distinction of finding his place in the top ten of both English writers and English painters. <br />

The reason he was disregarded is because he was very much ahead of his time in his views and his poetic style, and also because he was regarded as being somewhat mad, due to behaviour that would be thought of as only slightly eccentric today– for example, his naturistic habit of walking about his garden naked and sunbathing there. He illustrated his poems and the poems of others like Chaucer, Dante and Milton but his exhibitions of these illustrations were sneered at, and one reviewer wrote that they were  ‘nonsense, unintelligibleness and egregious vanity,’ and another called Blake ‘an unfortunate lunatic. <br />

Regarding his views, he was vehemently opposed to organised religion and the way it constrained natural human activity, such as sex. In one of his poems, The Garden of Love, he specifically accuses the church of that. During a walk in the garden of love he sees ‘priests in black gowns were walking their rounds/And binding with briars my joys and desires.’ <br />

Blake began training as an illustrator and engraver and worked at that as his day job. And in the meantime, he wrote his poems. <br />

The most important thing about Blake as a poet is his rejection of the highly sophisticated verse structures of the 18th century: he looked back to the more immediate, accessible poetry of Shakespeare, Jonson and the Jacobeans. He used monosyllabic words and packed more meaning and feeling into them that any of the poets of his time did, writing their expansive, sophisticated poems full of figures of speech. For example, two of Blake’s most famous collections: Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience contain some of the finest and most profound of English poems, all done in the most simple language. <br />

Songs of Innocence reveals a world of childhood innocence, written in nursery rhyme rhythms but containing shadows of the world of experience to come – so The Lamb, often taught to children to recite as a nursery rhyme has its counterpart in the Songs of Experience in The Tyger (Tyger tiger burning bright/In the forests of the night…) The Tyger is also expressed as a nursery rhyme and learnt by children but it is at the opposite end of experience. <br />

The poems in The Songs of Experience pack a huge punch. Take a look at The Sick Rose. It has only thirty-three words, only five of which have two syllables. And yet the poem goes deep into the world of relationships and social attitudes:  <br />

<b><i>‘O Rose, thou art sick! <br />
The invisible worm <br />
That flies in the night, <br />
In the howling storm, <br />
Has found out thy bed <br />
Of crimson joy, <br />
And his dark secret love <br />
Does thy life destroy.’</b></i>
<br />

The idea of love destroying someone’s life is at the centre of the poem. The love is forced to be dark and secret because social attitudes, conditioned by the Church, are opposed to sexual love. The language is highly sexual – crimson joy, bed of crimson joy, worm etc – and what should be something joyful becomes a disease instead.
<br />

Decades before Charles Dickens’ great  novels that depicted the suffering of the poor Blake was writing poems about the terrible phenomena of chimneysweeps, beggars and the injustice of social inequality. In wandering through the streets of London he sees these horrors:
<br />

<b><i>‘How the Chimney-sweeper’s cry
<br />
Every black’ning Church appals
<br />
And the hapless Soldier’s sigh
<br />
Runs in blood down Palace walls.’</b></i>
<br />

William Blake’s most famous poem Jerusalem <b><i>(“And did those feet in ancient times”)</b></i>, is still regularly sung as an anthem at gatherings of numerous societies, and at the end of the world’s top music festival, the Proms in London, by a well known singer.

<h1> <i>Jane Austen 1775 – 1817</i>: </h1>
<hr />
<p> <b><i>The Jane Austen is perhaps the best known and best loved of Bath’s many famous residents and visitors.’</b></i> <br />

One wonders at the restraint in that, considering that Jane Austen is indisputably one of the greatest English writers – some say<b><i> the greatest after Shakespeare</b></i> – and certainly the greatest English novelist and one of the most famous English women who ever lived. The insights found in Jane Austen’s quotes from her many works is very impressive. <br />

A mark of her genius is that she was there near the beginning of the novel’s emergence as a literary form, and all of her novels, including the earliest of them, written when she was very young, are perfectly formed. No English novelist has since bettered them and the novel hasn’t developed much since her definitive examples of the form. That is amazing when one thinks about how the other art forms –painting, music, architecture – fall out of fashion with each generation, and give way to new forms. And also when one thinks about how many novels have been written since hers. <br />
 
One has to ask why it is that her novels have lasted and are still widely read. One thing is certain: when one settles down with a Jane Austen novel one can be sure that there are going to be hours of <b><i>pleasure and a lot of chuckling.</b></i> <br /><br />
